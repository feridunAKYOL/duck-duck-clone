# Project of DuckDuckGo Clone
### TARGET
In this project we try to build DuckDuckGo webpage only by using **HTML5** and **CSS3**. Different from first two project,
in this project I build on my own :muscle:. Namely no tutorial :laughing:
The most important thing for me I have used `bootstrap`. this is the first time. I try to learn. 

We have 3 main target by doing such a project:  
>>* using some features for `accesibility`
>>* Learning steps in `git`; creating a `branch`, `pull request`, `push`, `commit`, `add`, `merge`  
>>* We try to learn that how we can create a more responsive page by using `Bootstrap` :sweat_drops:
>>* And of course develop in *HTML* and *CSS*
